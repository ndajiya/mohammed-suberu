      <h2>The Impact of Personality on Economic Decisions</h2>
      <p>Economic personality refers to how individual psychological traits influence financial decision-making and economic behavior.</p>
      <h3>Key Personality Traits in Economics</h3>
      <p>Research has identified several personality traits that significantly impact economic decisions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Risk Tolerance</strong> - How comfortable individuals are with financial uncertainty</li>
        <li><strong>Time Preference</strong> - The tendency to prefer immediate or delayed rewards</li>
        <li><strong>Self-Control</strong> - The ability to resist immediate gratification for long-term benefits</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Practical Applications</h3>
      <p>Understanding your economic personality can help you make better financial decisions and develop more effective money management strategies.</p>
      <h3>The Role of Psychology in Markets</h3>
      <p>Markets are influenced by collective psychological factors, making economic personality a crucial factor in understanding market behavior.Also, 
      rationality assumes people make decisions based on perfect information and careful calculation of costs and benefits. With economic personality 
      rationality can be narrowed down to learning where uncertainty also stems from.</p>
